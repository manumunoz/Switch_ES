                <h5>Groups, Appearances & Labels</h5>
                In Part {{ Constants.part_fixed }} you will participate with {{ Constants.others }} other players
                (the same as in Part {{ Constants.part_name }}). Each player is randomly assigned to a group
                &#9679 "{{ circles_label }}" or &#9650 "{{ triangles_label }}" (inner symbol) , and will also have an
                appearance &#9711 or &#9651 (símbolo externo). Each player will also have a numeric label from 1 to
                {{ names }}. You will see the group, appearance and label of each player on the screen (see Figure 1).
                <br><br>
                On the header of each screen you will see a summary of this information as in the example below:
                <br><br>
                <img width="70%" src="{% static "inst_fixed_en/Img_B4.png" %}"/>
                <br>
                In each round there will be {{ Constants.total_circles }} players in group &#9679 "{{ circles_label }}"
                and {{ Constants.total_triangles }} in group &#9650 "{{ triangles_label }}".
                A player’s group and appearance <b>will not change</b> between rounds during Part {{ Constants.part_fixed }},
                hile his numeric label and position in the screen will be <b>randomly changed in each round</b>.
                <br><br>
                For instance, the player in the header above is in group &#9679 "{{ circles_label }}"
                and has the numeric label 7 in round 1. In round 2, the same player will be in the same group than before
                but his label may be any number from 1 to {{ names }}, and his position may be anywhere on the screen.
                The same is the case for all other players.

                <h5>Stage 1: Connections</h5>
                In the <b>Connections stage</b> you can propose a connection to those players you want to participate with
                in Stage 2. You can propose a connection to any player no matter their group or appearance. If you propose
                a connection to a player who <b>also</b> proposes to you, there is an <b>active connection</b> between the
                two of you. In Stage 2 you will <b>only participate</b> with the players with whom you have an active connection.
                <br><br>
                You will see your connections on the screen (see Figure 2). There is a <span id="out_tie">light arrow</span>
                leaving from you for each connection you proposed, and a <span id="in_tie">dark arrow</span> heading towards
                you for each connection proposed to you. <b>If both</b> arrows are present you have an <b>active connection</b>
                with that other player. If only one of you proposes a connection but the other does not, there is no active
                connection between the two of you. <i>*Your connections are illustrated with thicker lines and those of others
                are thinner.</i>

                <h5>Stage 2: Actions</h5>
                In the <b>Actions stage</b> you will pick one of two actions: <button class="btn button1 btn-sm" disabled>Cyan</button> or
                <button class="btn button2 btn-sm" disabled>Terra</button>. You only pick one action for the stage, not one for each connection.
                You will get {{ Constants.exp_currency }} for each of your active connections choosing <b> the same action as you</b>. You will
                <b>not</b> get any {{ Constants.exp_currency }} for an active connection choosing <b>a different action</b> than you, nor from
                a player choosing the same action as you, if he <b>is not</b> an active connection.
                <br><br>
                The action chosen by each player is illustrated by the color of his appearance (see Figure 3).
